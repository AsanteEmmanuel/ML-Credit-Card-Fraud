# ML-Credit-Card-Fraud
This project aims to predict fraudulent credit card transactions using various classification models.

## Data 
The data is a combination of credit card transactions over years 2018 - 2022 (Check Kaggle)

## Models
The models implemented are Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine. I employ cross-validation to get more robust estimates of the best model.
